    "# 1. Introduction to the task\n",
    "\n",
    "Relation extraction is the task of detecting and classifying the relationship between two entities in text.\n",
    "DeepPavlov provides the document-level relation extraction meaning that the relation can be detected between the entities that are not in one sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RE Model Architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "We based our model on the [Adaptive Thresholding and Localized Context Pooling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11304.pdf) model and used NER entity tags as additional input. Two core ideas of this model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive Threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual global threshold for converting the RE classifier output probability to relation label is replaced with a learnable one. A new threshold class that learns an entities-dependent threshold value is introduced and learnt as all other classes. During prediction the positive classes (= relations that are hold in the sample indeed) are claimed to be the classes with higher logins that the TH class, while all others are negative ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Localised Context Pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "The embedding of each entity pair is enhanced with an additional local context embedding related to both entities. Such representation, which is attended to the relevant context in the document, is useful to decide the relation for exactly this entity pair. For incorporating the context information the attention heads are directly used.\n",
